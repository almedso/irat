# Motivation

Embedded software centric and Rust centric.

## Reference Architecture 

The reference architecture can act as blue print,

It encourages the software quality attributes:

**No overhead**: Only the amount of software that is really necessary

* Improved maintenance less code to maintain
* No runtime side effects

**Open closed principle**: 




**Common Reuse principle**: Clean interfaces

* Embedded HAL api is universal since software mapping abstraction
  is possible for established/ standardized hardware peripherals like
  i2c, spi, uart, gpio
*


## Sample projects

* An embedded project is not just software but hardware, and physical
  interfaces to the environment.
* A close link needs to be maintained between between all those parts
* SysML is one very valid approach for industrial grade project

For this kind or software centric playground documented sample projects
are chosen to provide evidence for the software reference architecture
applied.
